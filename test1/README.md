# Image Processing and Object Detection

This script uses OpenCV and a YOLO model for object detection on images of shelves. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- Pre-trained YOLO model files (`yolov3.cfg`, `yolov3.weights`, `coco.names`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd image_processing_ml
