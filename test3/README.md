# Part 3: Data Handling and Augmented Reality Integration

## Description
This script integrates object detection results with augmented reality (AR) by overlaying bounding boxes and labels on images. It uses OpenCV to manipulate images and simulate AR effects with annotations and color overlays.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

### Setup
1. Place input images in the `assets/input_images` directory.
2. Define bounding boxes and labels in the script (`ar_integration.py`) for testing.

### Execution
Run the script:
```bash
python ar_integration.py
